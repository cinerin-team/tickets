if you got something to this:
The msedgedriver version (128.0.2739.67) detected in PATH at msedgedriver.EXE might not be compatible with the detected MicrosoftEdge version (132.0.2957.127); currently, msedgedriver 132.0.2957.127 is recommended for MicrosoftEdge 132.*, so it is advised to delete the driver in PATH and retry

then:
download from here:

replace the msgedgedriver.exe
